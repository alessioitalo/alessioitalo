Hi! :wave:


My name is Alessio, :it: national based in :uk:. 


I am currently self-teaching software/web development. :computer:


My first approach with software development was with ![py logo](https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-and-brands-adobe/512/267_Python-48.png)
in October 2020. Since then, I grew interested in web development and I started studying ![js logo](https://cdn4.iconfinder.com/data/icons/logos-and-brands/512/187_Js_logo_logos-48.png) too.

Wish me luck in my journey to becoming a full-stack web developer!
